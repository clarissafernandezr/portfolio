    <p id="textabout">My name is Clarissa Fernandez! I am from Maracaibo, Venezuela and just recently moved to the U.S. to become a Computational Media student at Georgia Tech. I'm particularly interested in learning how we can use technology in innovative ways. I'm interested in creating cutting-edge software, stunning websites, virtual reality, and video game design. In Venezuela, where I was engaged to artistically direct branding projects, I worked as a graphic designer during my senior year of high school for several different brands. However, I couldn't only want to do art because of how much I love STEM. Because of this, my current emphasis and passion is leveraging software to uncover opportunities at the nexus of technology and the arts.
